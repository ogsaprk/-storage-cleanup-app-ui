# AI Prompt for Storage Cleanup App UI

"A modern, clean mobile app UI for a storage cleanup and phone optimization app. The interface should show an overview dashboard with a large circular progress bar indicating storage used vs. free. Sections below display categories like 'Junk Files,' 'Large Files,' 'Duplicate Photos,' and 'App Cache,' each with icons and clean progress bars. Use a sleek tech-inspired color scheme — white, blue, and green tones — with minimalist icons. Add a 'Clean Now' button at the bottom glowing slightly. The app looks user-friendly, futuristic, and highly functional."
